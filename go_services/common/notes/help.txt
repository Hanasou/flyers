I'll just be jotting down a few useful notes on using this package for my services

- Add "require github.com/Hanasou/flyers/go_services/common" into the go.mod file for each service you want to import this into
- Use "go get github.com/Hanasou/flyers/go_services/common/package_name" if the library is outdated and you need to fetch a new package
- Updating packages is extremely troublesome, I still don't exactly know why or why it doesn't work, I think it could just be really slow at picking up changes sometimes
- Possibly need to do "go clean -modcache" to update packages properly
