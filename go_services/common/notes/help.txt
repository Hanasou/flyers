I'll just be jotting down a few useful notes on using this package for my services

- Add "require github.com/Hanasou/flyers/go_services/common" into the go.mod file for each service you want to import this into
- Use "go get github.com/Hanasou/flyers/go_services/common/package_name" if the library is outdated and you need to fetch a new package
