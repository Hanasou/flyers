Triage
It's been a while since I worked on this, so I'll just go over and triage what I have in this so far

Okay, I'm just going to deprecate this entire thing. Everything that I'm interested in migrating over to my gateway service include:
- graphql stuff
- grpc stuff
- utility functions
- shutdown hook

I don't think I actually care enough to look over all of this and migrate it, might as well just start from scratch.
Hopefully this will be easier since I already did this stuff prior.
